                Before the game begins, you will find yourself in the wardrobe. There you can customize
                your character. Pick a character class and optional talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also invite other players into your game. It is usually easier with more players,
                but you may not get all the achievements. In the wardrobe you have time to chat and work
                out a strategy.

                Once the game begins, you will have a limited time (about 20 minutes) to finish it.
                If you finish it within the limit and complete all objectives, your attempt will
                appear on the leaderbord.

                Winning a game also gives you access to all assets which were used in it. You
                can then use those to build your own encounters.

                The editor is very simple to use. Although we use a scripting language internally,
                you don't have to know any programing. Most of the interface is built around
                number input elements, dropdown menus, checkboxes and buttons.

                We've been toying with the idea for this game for a long time, but
                finally in late 2011 we decided to start working on it. So now here we
                are, the three of us, working on this little project in our spare time.
